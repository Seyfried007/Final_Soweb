### Analysis Summary

# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture Report

This codebase exhibits a clear separation of concerns, aligning with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The frontend, built with React, primarily handles the **View** layer, while the backend, implemented with Node.js/Express, manages the **Model** and **Controller** layers.

## High-Level Architecture

The application is structured into two main parts: a frontend and a backend.

*   **Frontend (View):** Located in the [src/](src/) directory, this part is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It communicates with the backend via API calls.
*   **Backend (Model & Controller):** Located in the [backend/](backend/) directory, this part handles business logic, data persistence, and API exposure. It receives requests from the frontend, processes them, interacts with the database, and sends back responses.

Communication between the frontend and backend occurs through RESTful API endpoints defined in the backend.

## View Layer

The **View** layer is implemented in the frontend, primarily using React components. These components are responsible for presenting data to the user and capturing user input.

### Key Components:

*   **Main Application Entry Point:** The [main.tsx](src/main.tsx) file initializes the React application and renders the root [App.tsx](src/App.tsx) component.
*   **Root Application Component:** The [App.tsx](src/App.tsx) component likely defines the main layout and routing for the application.
*   **UI Components:** The [src/components/](src/components/) directory contains various reusable UI components, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface. Examples include:
    *   [AlertList.tsx](src/components/Alerts/AlertList.tsx): Displays alerts to the user.
    *   [LoginForm.tsx](src/components/Auth/LoginForm.tsx): Handles user authentication input.
    *   [ProductList.tsx](src/components/Products/ProductList.tsx): Renders a list of products.
    *   [Header.tsx](src/components/Layout/Header.tsx) and [Sidebar.tsx](src/components/Layout/Sidebar.tsx): Define the application's layout.
*   **Contexts:** The [src/context/](src/context/) directory provides global state management, which can influence how views are rendered.
    *   [AuthContext.tsx](src/context/AuthContext.tsx): Manages authentication state.
    *   [InventoryContext.tsx](src/context/InventoryContext.tsx): Manages inventory-related state.

These components interact with the backend by making HTTP requests (e.g., using `fetch` or a library like `axios`) to retrieve or send data.

## Controller Layer

The **Controller** layer resides in the backend and is responsible for handling incoming requests, processing them, and orchestrating the interaction between the View and the Model.

### Key Components:

*   **Express Application:** The main Express application is set up in [app.ts](backend/src/app.ts). This file configures middleware, defines routes, and starts the server.
*   **Route Definitions:** The [backend/src/routes/](backend/src/routes/) directory defines the API endpoints. Each route maps a specific URL path and HTTP method to a controller function.
    *   [productRoutes.ts](backend/src/routes/productRoutes.ts): Defines routes related to product operations.
    *   [userRoutes.ts](backend/src/routes/userRoutes.ts): Defines routes related to user operations.
*   **Controller Functions:** The [backend/src/controllers/](backend/src/controllers/) directory contains the core logic for handling requests. Each controller function receives a request, interacts with the Model (e.g., the database), and sends a response back to the client.
    *   [productController.ts](backend/src/controllers/productController.ts): Contains functions for handling product-related requests (e.g., `getProducts`, `createProduct`).
    *   [userController.ts](backend/src/controllers/userController.ts): Contains functions for handling user-related requests (e.g., `getUsers`, `createUser`).

Controller functions typically parse request bodies, validate input, call appropriate Model methods, and format the response data.

## Model Layer

The **Model** layer in the backend represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing data, interacting with the database, and enforcing business rules.

### Key Components:

*   **Database Connection:** The [db.ts](backend/src/db.ts) file is responsible for establishing and managing the connection to the database. It likely contains functions for executing database queries.
*   **Data Structures/Types:** The [src/types/index.ts](src/types/index.ts) file defines TypeScript interfaces or types that represent the shape of the data used throughout the application (e.g., `Product`, `User`). These types are crucial for maintaining data consistency between the frontend and backend.
*   **Business Logic (Implicit):** While not explicitly separated into a "service" layer, the business logic related to data manipulation and validation is embedded within the controller functions and the database interaction logic in [db.ts](backend/src/db.ts). For example, `productController.ts` will contain the logic for how products are created, updated, or retrieved, which involves interacting with the database via `db.ts`.

The Model layer provides an abstraction over the data storage, allowing the Controllers to interact with data without needing to know the underlying database implementation details.
